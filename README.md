# AutoDock Vina

AutoDock Vina is one of the fastest and most widely used open-source docking engines. It is a turnkey computational docking program that is based on a simple scoring function and rapid gradient-optimization conformational search. It was originally designed and implemented by Dr. Oleg Trott in the Molecular Graphics Lab.

## Bundle

This fork of AutoDock Vina adds changes that allow it to run as a part of Quantori DockingFactory. The head project of DockingFactory is [DockingFactory Bundle](https://github.com/quantori/scip-dockingfactory-bundle). Other projects that are also parts of the bundle are:
- [DockingFactory](https://github.com/quantori/scip-dockingfactory)
